# Nestorrig _Creative developer_

I’m Nestor Rios, an **Independent Creative Developer** passionate about blending design, animation, and technology to craft **interactive web experiences** that connect people and brands.

I collaborate with brands, studios, and organizations looking to stand out in the digital space through visually engaging and technically robust projects.

Although I’m technology-agnostic, I love working with tools like Astro, Three.js, React, R3F, GSAP, Howler.js, Storyblok, Netlify, and AWS.

Some of my projects have been featured on Awwwards, GSAP, and Three.js Journey.
